# Mems-based-Glucose-Sensor
Problem Statement: Designing and analysing the MEMS based glucose sensor using TWIN  CANTILEVER structure.  The cantilever are subjected to glucose solution and their outputs from deflections are supplied to OP-Amp as feedback resistance and input voltage. The degree of bending vs the concentration of the masses of glucose on the cantilever structure is observed.
